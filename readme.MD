# LudumDare 38: Crustal

_Theme: A small world. Date: April 21st to 23rd, 2017._

Our idea was to have small zone around a magic crystal that was filled with life and lush greens
the represents the small world you can live in. Sadly, some baddies out there are threatening in,
fight to protect it all costs in an endless battle that only intensifies as monsters spawn faster
and you find better weapons.
